Kali Linux Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Build Documentation


## 🧭 Overview

This repository documents my process of building and experimenting with the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server setup on **Kali Linux**.  
Throughout this project, I’ve referenced and utilized official resources and documentation from both the **[Model Context Protocol (MCP) website](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)** and the **[Claude (Anthropic) website](https://claude.ai/)** to guide implementation, configuration, and integration steps.

The goal of this documentation is to provide a detailed, hands-on record of my experience — from installation to setup, testing, and troubleshooting — to help others replicate or build upon similar MCP environments with Kali Linux.
